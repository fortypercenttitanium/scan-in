# scan-in

## Description

An application to make taking class attendance faster and easier.

## Purpose

Larger classes can be quite tedious to take attendance for. Having students scan in makes it so you can simply view which students are absent and take attendance that way. Also, some teachers may want the students to work on a do-now at the beginning of class and taking attendance verbally can be an interruption. This app allows you to take attendance quickly and silently while students work.

This project was designed as a solution to my frustration with the tediousness of taking attendance in one of my classes that had over 70 students. With only 40 minutes to get my lesson done, taking attendance was a major time-waster. With this app, I've been able to start classes much faster and students who walk in late no longer require me to modify my attendance later. I simply take attendance _after class_, and account for any students who were late by looking at timestamps.

## How To Use

Create a class, add your students manually or by pasting data from OnCourse, then "Take Attendance" for your class. Students can manually enter their student ID on the numpad or you can hook up a USB barcode scanner to your computer to scan students in.

## Auth

This app currently only uses Microsoft OAuth as that met my needs at the time. I do not plan to continue developing this project for the time being, so I will not be adding additional authorization strategies.
